<p>I spent much of 2014 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technologyâ€™s histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong> is a collection of fourteen of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to convivial tools, from ed-tech mansplaining to information justice.</p>
